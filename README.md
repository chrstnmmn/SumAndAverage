<h1 style = "text-align: center" >JAVA PROJECT 101</h1>

#### Hi everyone, I'm excited to share my first ever Java project with you. This is part of my journey learning how to code, and it's also a way for me to track my progress as I work on improving myself this year.

---

## This project is all about summing up the number and getting the average.

### Here is the Algorithm:

> - Getting the user input (only number)
>
> - Keep getting the user input until the user entered the command "DONE"
>
> - Getting the sum of all input
>
> - Getting the average

### Code snippets

> Getting the user input:
> ![Getting the user input..](./UserInput.png "Getting the user input.")
>
> Keep getting the user input until the user entered the command "DONE":
> ![Keep asking the user img..](./DONE.png "Keep asking the user.")
>
> Getting the Sum and Average:
> ![Getting the sum and average..](./SUMAVG.png "Getting the sum and average.")

> 1. This line checks if the variable **count** is greater than 0. The variable **count** likely represents the number of numbers that have been entered by the user. If **count** is greater than 0, it means at least one number has been entered, and the code inside the **if** block will execute. If **count** is less than or equal to 0, it means no numbers were entered, and the code inside the **else** block will execute.
