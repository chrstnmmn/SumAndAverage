<h1 style = "text-align: center" >JAVA PROJECT 101</h1>

#### Hi everyone, I'm excited to share my first ever Java project with you. This is part of my journey learning how to code, and it's also a way for me to track my progress as I work on improving myself this year.

## This project is all about summing up the number and getting the average. 
###  Here is the Algorithm:
> - Getting the user input (only integer)
>
> - Keep getting the user input until the user entered the command "DONE"
>
> - Getting the sum of all input
>
> - Getting the average
